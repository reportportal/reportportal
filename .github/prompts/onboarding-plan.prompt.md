# Create My Onboarding Plan

I'm a new contributor joining ReportPortal and I need help creating a structured onboarding plan.

My background: ${input:background:Briefly describe your experience level - new to tech, experienced developer new to this stack, etc.}

Please create a personalized phased onboarding plan that includes the following phases.

## Phase 1 - Foundation

Environment setup with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting tips, plus identifying the most important documentation to read first

## Phase 2 - Exploration

Codebase discovery starting with README files, running existing tests/scripts to understand workflows, and finding beginner-friendly first tasks like documentation improvements. If possible, find me specific open issues or tasks that are suitable for my background.

## Phase 3 - Integration

Learning team processes, making first contributions, and building confidence through early wins

For each phase, break down complex topics into manageable steps, recommend relevant resources, provide concrete next steps, and suggest hands-on practice over just reading theory.
