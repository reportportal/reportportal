## Installation steps

### Simple setup with Docker

It's the best way for demo purposes and small teams. The database is already in the docker-compose.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) ([Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))

2. Download [Example of docker-compose descriptor](https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) to any folder

3. Give correct permissions to ElasticSearch data folder using the following commands:

```bash
$ mkdir -p data/elasticsearch

$ chmod 777 data/elasticsearch

$ chgrp 1000 data/elasticsearch
```

4. Deploy ReportPortal using `docker compose plugin` within the same folder

```bash
$ docker compose -p reportportal up
```

To start ReportPortal in daemon mode, add '-d' argument:

```bash
$ docker compose -p reportportal up -d
```

5. Open in your browser IP address of deployed environment at port `8080`

```
http://IP_ADDRESS:8080
```

6. Use next login\pass for access:

- `default\1q2w3e`
- `superadmin\erebus`.

>Please change admin password for security.

>Mentioned compose file deploy all available Bug Tracking System integrations, which not always needed, but use resources.

### Production-ready set and Custom deployment with Docker

For production usage, we recommend:

- choose only required Bug Tracking System integration service. Exclude the rest

To customize deployment and make it production-ready please follow [customization steps and details](https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/wiki/Production-Ready-set-and-Deployment-Customization)

## Integration. How to get log data in

You should add **Client Side** code inside your test automation. It consists of:

- [`client-*`](https://github.com/reportportal?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=client-) - API integrations. Http clients, which process HTTP request sending. E.g. for Java ([`client-java-*`](https://github.com/reportportal?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=client-java-))
- [`agent-*`](https://github.com/reportportal?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=agent-) - Frameworks integration. Custom reporters/listeners, which monitor test events and trigger event sending via [`client-*`](https://github.com/reportportal?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=client-)
- [`logger-*`](https://github.com/reportportal?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=logger-) - Logging integration. Logger appenders, which helps to collect logs, bind it with test-case via `agent-*` and send to server via `client-*`
